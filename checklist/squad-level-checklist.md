# Accessibility Checklist

Guidance for how to make your interfaces accessible

|Category|Success Criteria|How To Test|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Form Inputs|Every enabled and disabled input MUST have a label set via the input `label` parameter. The label must accurately convey the purpose of the input.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the label parameter for a value, it must not be null.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the input using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader must announce the field label.<br><br>**Tool Testing**: <br>• **axe DevTools**: Run a page scan. Works for all inputs except text and paragraph fields. Scan must be run in a browser, must not be run in Appian Designer. Possible errors: ARIA input fields must have an accessible name; Form elements must have labels<br>• **ARC Toolkit**: Run the Interactive Controls or Custom Widgets test. Scan must be run in a browser, must not be run in Appian Designer. Possible errors: Invalid aria-labelledby; Input has no accessible name; Empty label text<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: What to check varies on the type of input. Check the value being used or referenced by the following: The string used for the `aria-label` attribute set on the input; A string contained in the node referenced by the ID used for the `aria-labelledby` attribute; OR the value contained in the `<label>` element that has a `for` attribute value set equal to the ID of the input.|
|Form Inputs|Placeholder text alone MUST NOT be used to convey important information for form inputs, such as valid ranges, formats, input lengths, etc.|Visual inspection.|
|Form Inputs|Every input MUST have a persistently visible label (using placeholder text or currently selected values does not meet this requirement). Passes by default when the input uses a `label` parameter value and a `labelPosition` parameter value of any value other than `COLLAPSED`.|Visual inspection.|
|Form Inputs|The `label` parameter value for each input MUST contain at least the same string used for the visible label. Passes by default when the input uses a `label` parameter value and a `labelPosition` parameter value of any value other than `COLLAPSED`.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `label` parameter value used for the input. If the `label` parameter uses a `labelPosition` of `COLLAPSED`, compare the value of the `label` parameter to the rich text used for the visual label.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the input using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader must announce a label for the input that includes at least the same string as the visible label.|
|Form Inputs|Duplicated controls having the same name in the same interface have additional context provided by accessibility text, icon altText, or by outputting each repeated form section in a labeled section or box layout. Context provided by accessibility text or icon altText should indicate what content the input is associated with or performs an action on. Does not apply to controls output in grids.|**Visual Inspection**: Identify controls in the interface that use the same input label text, link text, button text, or single icon.<br><br>**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `label` and `accessibilityText` parameter values used for the inputs. If icons are used in the controls, inspect the `altText` and `caption` parameter values set on the icons. Check if repeated form sections are using a labeled `a!sectionLayout` or `a!boxLayout`.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the inputs/controls using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys, note if the screen reader announces the same name for each duplicated input/control. Put the screen reader into Browse mode and read any hidden content (usually accessibility text) immediately prior to or after the input/control and note if the hidden content provides context for the input/control. If no context is present, attempt to navigate to each repeated form section using the landmark/region navigation hotkey with the screen reader.|
|Form Inputs|Each individual checkbox and radio button MUST have a label set via the `choiceLabels` parameter.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `choiceLabels` parameter on `a!checkboxfield` or `a!radioButtonField` and ensure the labels do not use a null value.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: <br>• **Checkboxes**: Navigate to the individual checkbox using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys<br>• **Radio Buttons**: Use the Up or Down arrow key to navigate to additional radio buttons once the selected radio button receives keyboard focus via the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys<br>• The screen reader should announce the same name for each control that is output adjacent to the control<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Locate the checkbox or radio button in the DOM. Inspect the `<label>` element used for the input. The `<label>` FOR attribute must match the ID of the checkbox or radio button and the value in the `<label>` element must not be null and must not equal "&ZeroWidthSpace;".|
|Form Inputs|Checkbox and radio button components MUST have a `label` parameter set when more than one checkbox or radio button is present in the group.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `label` parameter on `a!checkboxField` or `a!radioButtonField` and ensure it has a value.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: <br>• **Checkboxes**: Navigate to the first checkbox in the group using the TAB key or to the last checkbox in the group using the SHIFT + TAB keys<br>• **Radio buttons**: Navigate to the currently selected radio button using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. If no radio buttons are selected, use the same approach indicated above for checkboxes<br>• The screen reader should announce the label value and identify the checkbox or radio button as being a "grouping" or "group"<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: <br>• **Checkboxes**: Locate the element that has `role="group"` set on it<br>• **Radio buttons**: Locate the element that has `role="radiogroup"` set on it<br>• Locate the DOM node referenced by the ID used for the `aria-labelledby` attribute set on the element having `role="group"` or `role="radiogroup"`. This DOM node must contain the label text.|
|Form Inputs|Text fields that accept PERSONAL information from the user MUST have the appropriate `inputPurpose` parameter set on the input. Note that the "Name" input purpose should only be used for a single input that accepts the user's entire name. Input purpose MUST NOT be set if the content can be accessed on a public computer or device.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect that the text field (`a!textField`) has an appropriate `inputPurpose` parameter value.<br><br>**Keyboard Testing**: Navigate to the input using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. A list with previously-supplied input values (that YOU have entered previously) should become visible when the input receives keyboard focus.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Ensure the input (`<input type="text">`) has an appropriate autocomplete attribute value.|
|Validations|Inputs that are required MUST have the `required` parameter set to TRUE.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure the input `required` parameter is set to TRUE.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the input using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader should announce "required" in addition to the input name, role, etc.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Ensure the input has `aria-required="true"` set on it.|
|Validations|OOTB validation MUST be used for all form input error messaging/validation.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure the appropriate `validations`, `validationGroup`, and `validationMessage` parameters are set.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the input that has an error using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader should announce the visible error message text and the input as having an "invalid entry" when the input receives keyboard focus.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: When an error is present, ensure the `aria-describedby` attribute set on the input references the ID of the DOM node that contains the visible error message.|
|Validations|The input name MUST be included in the error message text regardless of the type of validation that has failed. The typical format is "[input name] requires a value.", "[input name] must be numeric.", etc.|Visual inspection.|
|Instructions|The input `instructions` parameter MUST be used for visible form input instructions, expected formats, valid input ranges, etc.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the input `instructions` parameter and ensure it is set to the same value used for the instructions that appear on the screen.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the input using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader should announce the visible onscreen instructions when the input receives keyboard focus.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Ensure the `aria-describedby` attribute set on the input references the ID of the DOM node that contains the instruction text.|
|Forms|Forms having required inputs that use an asterisk MUST have a visible legend at the beginning of the form prior to the first input. The typical format is "Required fields are marked with an asterisk (\*)".|Visual inspection.|
|Forms|Keyboard focus MUST NOT be moved to a form input when the form initializes if there is important information positioned before the input. Set `focusOnFirstInput=FALSE` on the form.|**Visual Inspection**: Identify important information at the beginning of or prior to the form and observe if focus is being moved to an input positioned after that information when the form is initialized.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: When the form is initialized, verify that important information positioned prior to or at the beginning of the form can be immediatly accessed using forward navigation with the screen reader Forms and Browse modes.|
|Forms|Information that a user must re-enter to complete a form, wizard, or milestone MUST be auto-populated or available for the user to select.|Visual inspection. Note any information that a user has entered in an earlier step in the process that must be re-entered in a later step.|
|Grids|Every grid MUST have a label set via the `label` parameter on the grid. The label can use a `labelPosition` of `COLLAPSED` if the grid is preceded by a visible heading that describes the content in or purpose of the grid.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `label` parameter on `a!gridField` and ensure it uses a value that summarizes or describes the content in the grid.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the grid by pressing the T key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + T (VoiceOver). The screen reader should announce a value that summarizes or describes the content in the grid when the grid is navigated to.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Locate the `<table>` element. Ensure the DOM node referenced by the `aria-labelledby` attribute set on the `<table>` element contains the grid label text.|
|Grids|Each grid column that contains data or a single form input MUST have column header text. Columns that contain multiple controls such as an action menu, links that move rows up/down, download link, etc. do not need a column header as long as non-sighted users can understand the cell information based on the controls in the cell.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `label` parameter on `a!gridColumn` for each column in the grid and ensure it is not null.<br><br>**Visual Inspection**: Inspect the first cell at the top of each column for text.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Using the screen reader table navigation keys, read each column header cell in the grid row using left or right cell navigation (CTRL + ALT + Left/Right arrow keys).<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Examine each `<th>` tag within the `<thead>` tag and ensure they contain a value.|
|Grids|The grid row header MUST be defined using the `rowHeader` parameter when the content in the cell is unique and summarizes all content in the row. NOTE: Be careful with setting row headers on editable grids. All information associated with an input that is contained within the cell that is defined as the row header is announced by screen readers as part of the row header value, such as character counters, hidden instructions for operating dropdowns, etc. Setting the row header in this case must take into account how much information will be announced by the screen reader as grid cells are navigated and whether that information may be confusing for users.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `rowHeader` parameter for `a!gridField` and ensure it is set to a numeric value (the position of the cell within the row) that corresponds to the cell that should be defined as the row header.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Using the screen reader table navigation keys, navigate to any column to the right of the column that should have the row header set. Navigate cells in those columns up and down (CTRL + ALT + Up/Down arrow keys). The screen reader should announce the row header cell value prior to announcing the value in the cell currently navigated to.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Ensure the cell that should be defined as the row header is defined as a  `<tr>` having `scope="row"` set on it.|
|Grids|Empty grid columns MUST NOT be used for spacing.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect each `a!gridColumn` or `a!gridLayoutHeaderCell` for a label value and valid `value` parameter setting.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the grid by pressing the T key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + T (VoiceOver). The screen reader should announce the same number of columns as are visible. Table navigation keys can also be used to navigate a grid row from left to right or right to left (CTRL + ALT + Left/Right arrow keys). The name of each column should be announced by the screen reader prior to any value in the cell that has been navigated to.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Ensure each  `<tr>` used for column headers contains a text value.|
|Grids|Grid instructions MUST be associated with the grid using the grid `instructions` parameter. Do not use the word "grid" in the instruction text, use "table".|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the grid for the `instructions` parameter. It should contain the same instruction text as the text output visually.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the grid by pressing the T key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + T (VoiceOver). The screen reader should announce the instructions when the grid is navigated to.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Locate the `<table>` element. Ensure the DOM node ID referenced by the `aria-describedby` attribute set on the `<table>` element contains the instruction text.|
|Grids|When controls positioned above a grid can become enabled based on grid row selection, accessibility text is set on the grid to warn non-sighted users of this function PRIOR TO interaction with the grid OR users are notified of the controls becoming enabled AFTER being enabled by use of the message banner component. If accessibility text is used, do not use the word "grid" in the text, use "table".|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the grid for the `accessibilityText` parameter. The parameter should contain text that indicates controls positioned above the table become enabled when rows are selected. The text should not indicate that the controls prior to the table become disabled when all rows are deselected. If accessibility text is not present, check for the use of `a!messageBanner`.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the grid by pressing the T key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + T (VoiceOver). The screen reader should announce the accessibility text instructions when the grid is navigated to. If no accessibility text is announced, perform an action that enables controls above the grid and listen for a screen reader announcement that indicates controls above the grid have become enabled.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Locate the  `<table>` element. Ensure the DOM node referenced by the `aria-describedby` attribute set on the  `<table>` element contains the accessibility text. If this test is negative, locate a `<span>` element that uses `role="status"` and `class="LiveMessageReader---accessibilityhidden"` that contains text that indicates controls above the grid have been enabled.|
|Grids|Links used to move grid rows up and down MUST have a target size of at least 24 x 24 pixels OR when a 24 x 24 pixel circle is centered on each link, the circles do not intersect. Can be met by using 3 spaces between each link or buttons of any allowable size.|**Testing Overview**: There are two phases to testing. First, the target size of the links needs to be verified as being at least 24 x 24 pixels. If that test fails, then the spacing between the undersized targets needs to be verified. If both tests fail, then an accessibility failure is present.<br><br>**Phase 1 - Verify Target Size**: <br>• Open the browser DOM Inspect feature and select the active grid row ordering controls that are defined as links and are output adjacent to each other<br>• Hover over the link anchor in the DOM explorer, producing the popup in the browser for the link, note the link size indicated in the popup (you must examine the link anchor size, not the icon size)<br>• If this test yields a link size smaller than 24 x 24 pixels, then proceed to Phase 2. Otherwise, there is no failure present<br><br>**Phase 2 - Verify Spacing**: <br>• Because of restrictions by Appian, this target size bookmarklet (https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/YzdwWZw) needs to be used to create a visual representation of the targets that overlap on a page<br>• Install this bookmarklet and run it over the page (ensure the links being tested are in the viewable area of the browser window prior to running the bookmarklet). The bookmarklet will output 24 x 24 pixel circles on many elements on the page<br>• Pay specific attention to the circles that are output over the grid row ordering links, and note if they overlap. An overlap indicates a failure of the requirement<br>• Once the bookmarklet is run, refresh the browser to clear the onscreen results<br>• **NOTE**: If the links are being tested within a dialog, the bookmarklet output will be present in the parent page that spawned the dialog, positioned exactly where the links were present in the dialog<br><br>**Alternative Phase 2 - Verify Spacing Test**: Use axe DevTools and run a full-page scan. If the spacing error is present, it will be indicated as "All touch targets must be 24px large, or leave sufficient space". Expand the error category and highlight all occurrences until the links being tested are highlighted. If using this tool, use the free (unpaid) version and ensure the testing threshold is set to WCAG 2.2. This test will not work if run over Interface Designer or if Appian design elements are present in the interface.|
|Grids|Grid row drag and drop MUST also use a single-click alternative such as links that allow the rows to be moved up or down by activating the link.|Visual inspection.|
|Headings|Text headings MUST be defined as semantic headings using the Heading component or a layout that accepts the `labelHeadingTag` parameter set to an appropriate value.|**SAIL Testing**: Verify the text is defined using `a!HeadingField` or the text is defined as the `label` parameter for a section or box layout that uses the appropriate `labelHeadingTag` parameter value.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the text by pressing the H key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + H (VoiceOver). The screen reader should identify the text as a heading in addition to announcing the heading text and heading level when the heading is navigated to.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Examine the text to determine if it is contained within an HTML heading tag (H1-H6).|
|Headings|Headings use appropriate heading levels set via the `headingTag` parameter (Heading componet) or `labelHeadingTag` parameter (section or box layout) that reflect the structure or importance of the content.|**SAIL Testing**: Verify the text is defined using `a!HeadingField` and uses an appropriate `headingTag` parameter value OR the text is defined as the `label` parameter for a section of box layout and uses the appropriate `labelHeadingTag` parameter value.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the text by pressing the H key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + H (VoiceOver). The screen reader should identify the text as a heading and indicate the appropriate heading level, in addition to announcing the heading text when the heading is navigated to.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Examine the text to determine if it uses the correct HTML heading tag (H1-H6).|
|Lists|Text and other elements that are output as list items using visual styling (bullets, checkmark icons, or other notation) MUST be defined as semantic lists using `a!richTextBulletedList` or `a!richTextNumberedList` (excludes navigation links).|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure `a!richTextDisplayField` is used, and ensure the list is defined using `a!richTextBulletedList` or `a!richTextNumberedList` (`a!styledTextEditorField` does not expose parameters for values provided).<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the text by pressing the L key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + X (VoiceOver). The screen reader should identify the area as a list and may or may not identify how many items are in the list. List items may be read one at a time with Browse mode. Some screen readers will identify the position within the list (e.g. "item 3 of 7"). All screen readers will announce that the list is being exited when navigating out of the list.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Examine the text and ensure it is contained with `<ul>`/`<li>` or `<ol>`/`<li>` markup.|
|Modal Dialog|Keyboard focus MUST NOT be moved to a form input when a modal dialog opens if there is important information positioned before the form input. Set `focusOnFirstInput=FALSE` on the form.|**Visual inspection**: Identify important information at the beginning of or prior to the form and observe if focus is being moved to an input positioned after that information.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: When the dialog is initialized, the screen reader should announce only the dialog name and identify the dialog (as "dialog"), it does not announce the name of an input when there is important information presented prior to the input that receives keyboard focus. Note that the dialog name is typically set to the name of the control that opened the dialog.|
|Pane Layout|Each pane layout MUST have a label set via accessibility text set on `a!pane`. Do not use the following terms in the accessibility text: pane, main, navigation, section, form, search, header, footer, article or region.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure the `accessibilityText` parameter is set on `a!pane`.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the pane by pressing the R key (JAWS), D key (NVDA), or VO + Shift + Down Arrow/Up Arrow (or the Rotor can be used) (VoiceOver). The screen reader should identify the pane as a "region" or "landmark" and announce the name/title of the pane.<br><br>**ARC Toolkit**: Run the Interactive Controls test. Panes without a label will have an error of "Invalid aria-labelledby". Run the test in a browser, do not run it in Appian Designer.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search the DOM for "region". On the resulting element having `role="region"`, ensure the `aria-labelledby` attribute references the DOM node that contains the pane accessibility text value.|
|Section Layout|Each expandable section layout MUST have a label provided by the `label` parameter and use an appropriate `labelHeadingTag` parameter value to indicate the heading level.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `label` parameter is set on `a!sectionLayout`. Inspect the `labelHeadingTag` parameter is set on `a!sectionLayout`. A value must be present for both parameters.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the section by pressing the H key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + H (VoiceOver). The screen reader should identify the section label text as a heading and announce the text. For expandable/collapsible sections, the text can be navigated to using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. In this case the screen reader should identify a button, heading, and announce the section name/label.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Inspect the section label text and verify it is contained within heading markup (H1-H6).|
|Box Layout|Each expandable box layout MUST have a label provided by the `label` parameter and use an appropriate `labelHeadingTag` parameter value to indicate the heading level.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `label` parameter is set on `a!boxLayout`. Inspect the `labelHeadingTag` parameter is set on `a!boxLayout`. Both parameters should have a value.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and navigate to the box by pressing the H key (Windows screen readers) or VO + Command + H (VoiceOver). The screen reader should identify the visible box label text as a heading and announce the text. For expandable/collapseable boxes, the text can be navigated to using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. In this case the screen reader should identify a button, heading, and announce the box name/label.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Inspect the section label text and verify it is contained within a `<div>` that has both `role="heading"` and the `aria-level` attribute set to the appropriate heading level.|
|Cards|Cards having a link set on the card MUST NOT contain other controls or inputs within the card.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure that if a `link` parameter value is provided for `a!cardLayout` that no other components within the card use a link, button, or any other input type.<br><br>**Screen Reader/Keyboard Testing**: Navigate to the card using the TAB key. Once the card has keyboard focus, press the TAB key again. Keyboard focus must not move to any other element inside of the card except to open a tooltip or caption.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for an element that has `role="link"` and `tabindex="1"` set on it. This element will use CSS classes beginning with the text "CardLayout". Examine the nodes within this element for active controls such as links, buttons, or other form inputs.|
|Cards|A `label` parameter value MUST NOT be used for a link that is set on a card.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure that if a `link` parameter value is provided for `a!cardLayout` that the `label` parameter value is null for the link.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the card using the TAB key. The screen reader should announce "link" only once in addition to any other content within the card when the card receives keyboard focus.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for an element that has `role="link"` and `tabindex="1"` set on it. This element will use CSS classes beginning with the text "CardLayout". Ensure the first child node of this element is not an  `<a>` tag.|
|Cards|When color or a decorative bar is used to indicate the card is the current selection, accessibility text of "Selected" MUST be set on the card. Cards that are not selected MUST NOT be indicated as such.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure the `accessibilityText` parameter on `a!cardLayout` is set to "Selected" and removed when the card is no longer selected.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: If the card has a link definition, navigate to the card link using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader should announce "Selected" in addition to all content within the card. If the card does not have a link definition, read the entire card using Browse mode with the screen reader. The screen reader should announce "Selected" in addition to all content within the card.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for an element that has `role="link"` and `tabindex="1"` set on it. This element will use CSS classes beginning with the text "CardLayout". Ensure the LAST child node of this element contains the text "Selected".|
|Links|Links embedded in text MUST use a method other than only color to differentiate the link from the surrounding text, such as a persistent underline (`linkStyle`: `INLINE`), font style/weight change, icon positioned after the link, OR have at least a 3:1 color contrast between the link text and the surrounding text. The link can also be repositioned on a new line where there is no text present on either side of the link.|Visual inspection.<br><br>**SAIL Testing**: The `linkStyle` parameter on `a!richTextItem` is set to `INLINE` or other formatting is used to differentiate the link from the surrounding text.|
|Links|When color or styling is used to indicate a RICH TEXT link is currently selected, accessibility text of "Selected" MUST NOT be set on the link UNLESS the rich text does not contain an icon. If an icon is used, the icon `altText` parameter has a value of "Selected". Links that are not selected MUST NOT be indicated as such. Setting the accessibility text parameter on the rich text link should be used only as a last resort.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the component. If no icon is used in the link, check for the `accessibilityText` parameter value of "Selected" set on `a!richTextDisplayField`. If the link uses an icon, ensure the `accessibilityText` parameter is not set on `a!richTextDisplayField` and instead, the `altText` OR `caption` parameter value of "Selected" is set on the icon.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: For active elements, navigate to the element using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. For inactive elements, put the screen reader into Browse mode and read the content with the Arrow keys. Regardless of how the element is accessed, the screen reader should announce the element as being "Selected" in addition to any content used in the element.|
|Breadcrumbs|Breadcrumbs MUST use accessibility text to identify the breadcrumb and the current (last) page in the breadcrumb.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure that the `accessibilityText` parameter value is set on `a!richTextDisplayField` that indicates the element is a breadcrumb and includes identification of the current (last) page in the breadcrumb, e.g., "Breadcrumbs, corporate is the current page". If the breadcrumb consists of single rich text elements for each part of the breadcrumb, the first rich text element is identified as a breadcrumb and the rich text used for the last element in the breadcrumb indicates "current page" via the accessibility text.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and read the breadcrumb. The screen reader should identify the element as a breadcrumb and indicate the current page prior to announcing all elements within the breadcrumb. Depending on the configuration, it is also OK if the screen reader identifies the current page directly before announcing the current page value.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for the paragraph (`<p>` tag) that contains the entire breadcrumb content. Traverse the DOM upward two `<div>` nodes and expand the second `<div>`. Verify that the text in the `<span>` contained in the second `<div>` contains text that indicates the element is a breadcrumb and indicates the current (last) page in the breadcrumb.|
|Progress Bar|Each progress bar MUST have a label defined by setting the `label` parameter on `a!progressBarField`.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure a `label` parameter value is provided for `a!progressBarField`.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Read the progress bar using Browse mode. A name/label for the progress bar should be announced by the screen reader prior to announcing the value in the progress bar.<br><br>**Tool Testing**<br>• **axe DevTools**: Run a page scan in a browser, do not run the scan in Appian Designer. If a label is not provided for the progress bar, the identified error is "ARIA progressbar nodes must have an accessible name".<br>• **ARC Toolkit**: Run the Interactive Controls test in a browser, do not run the test in Appian Designer. If a label is not provided for the progress bar, the identified error is "Invalid aria-labelledby".<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for "progressbar". Ensure the DOM node referenced by the `aria-labelledby` attribute set on the element having `role="progressbar"` contains text.|
|File Upload|The file upload MUST have a label set via the `label` parameter on `a!fileUploadField`.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure a `label` parameter value is provided for `a!fileUploadField`.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the Upload button using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader should announce a name/label for the button in addition to "upload" and "drop files here".<br><br>**ARC Toolkit**: Run the Interactive Controls test in a browser, do not run the test in Appian Designer. If a label is not provided for the file upload button, the identified error is "Invalid aria-describedby".<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for the Upload button. Ensure the DOM node referenced by the `aria-describedby` attribute set on the button contains text.|
|File Upload|Visible instructions for file upload MUST be set via the `instructions` parameter on `a!fileUploadField`.|**SAIL Testing**: Ensure an `instructions` parameter value is provided for `a!fileUploadField` and it is set to the instruction text that is output on the screen.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the Upload button using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader should announce the instructions in addition to a name/label for the button and "upload" and "drop files here".<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for the Upload button. Ensure the DOM node referenced by the `aria-describedby` attribute set on the button contains the instruction text. This should be referenced by the second, space-delimited ID used by the `aria-describedby` attribute where the ID ends with the text "-instructions".|
|Signature|An alternative keyboard method of acquiring a signature or indicating acceptance MUST be provided for the Signature component.|Visual inspection. Use an alternative method such as an accessible checkbox, dropdown, third-party element such as DocuSign, etc. Values should not be defaulted.|
|Simulated Grid|Data that is visually output as a grid but does not use a grid MUST have accessibility text set on each grid cell that contains the column "header" text and row header text (if appropriate).|**SAIL Testing**: Confirm there is an `accessibilityText` parameter value output as the first element in each "cell" that indicates what the visual "column header" is and the text of the cell used for the row header (if applicable).<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and read the content in a forward reading order. The screen reader should announce the visual "column header" text and the text of the cell used for the row header (if applicable) prior to announcing the value in the "cell".<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Not recommended for larger grids.|
|Custom Pagination Links|Links that are inactive/non-applicable MUST NOT use accessibility text that indicates the element(s) is a disabled link. Any accessibility text or icon text alternative used when the controls were applcable must be removed when they are not applicable.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect the `accessibilityText` parameter of the link and the `altText` or `caption` parameter values on the icon if present. Each parameter should have a null value or not be included in the SAIL.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and read the non-applicable pagination elements. The screen reader should ignore the elements and announce nothing.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Locate the non-applicable elements, they are defined as SVG. The SVG should have `focusable="false"`, `aria-hidden="true"` and `tabindex="-1"` set on it/them.|
|Custom Pagination Links|The active/available pagination links output immediately adjacent to each other MUST have a target size of at least 24 x 24 pixels OR when a 24 x 24 pixel circle is centered on each link, the circles do not intersect.|**Testing Overview**: There are two phases to testing. First, the target size of the links needs to be verified as being at least 24 x 24 pixels. If that test fails, then the spacing between the undersized targets needs to be verified. If both tests fail, then an accessibility failure is present.<br><br>**Phase 1 - Verify Target Size**: <br>• Open the browser DOM Inspect feature and select the active pagination links that are output adjacent to each other<br>• Hover over the link anchor in the DOM explorer, producing the popup in the browser for the link, note the link size indicated in the popup (you must examine the link anchor size, not the icon size)<br>• If this test yields a link size smaller than 24 x 24 pixels, then proceed to Phase 2. Otherwise, there is no failure present<br><br>**Phase 2 - Verify Spacing**: <br>• Because of restrictions by Appian, this target size bookmarklet (https://cdpn.io/pen/debug/YzdwWZw) needs to be used to create a visual representation of the targets that overlap on a page<br>•  Install this bookmarklet and run it over the page (ensure the links being tested are in the viewable area of the browser window prior to running the bookmarklet). The bookmarklet will output 24 x 24 pixel circles on many elements on the page<br>• Pay specific attention to the circles that are output over the active pagination links, and note if they overlap. An overlap indicates a failure of the requirement<br>• Once the bookmarklet is run, refresh the browser to clear the onscreen results<br>• **NOTE**: If the links are being tested within a dialog, the bookmarklet output will be present in the parent page that spawned the dialog, positioned exactly where the links were present in the dialog<br><br>**Alternative Phase 2 - Verify Spacing Test**: Use axe DevTools and run a full-page scan. If the spacing error is present, it will be indicated as "All touch targets must be 24px large, or leave sufficient space". Expand the error category and highlight all occurrences until the links being tested are highlighted. If using this tool, use the free (unpaid) version and ensure the testing threshold is set to WCAG 2.2. This test will not work if run over Interface Designer or if Appian design elements are present in the interface.|
|Workflow Visualization Plugin|An alternative view of content in the Workflow Visualization plugin MUST be provided when the plugin is used.|Visual inspection. Alternative views can include a grid, rich text, cards, or other means that convey the same information as the visualization. This can be a toggled view, appear on the same page, or linked to on a separate page. The alternate view must include any node information present in the visualization including the node name, immediate dependencies, and the next node in the process from the current node. If the node in the viualization can be drilled into, the alternative would also need to support that.|
|Date & Time Component|The Date & Time component MUST NOT be used.|**SAIL Testing**: Determine if `a!dateTimeField` is present in the interface.|
|Card Choice Field|The card choice field component MUST have a `label` parameter set when more than one card is present in the group.|**SAIL Testing**: Verify a `label` parameter value has been provided for `a!cardChoiceField` when more than one card is present in the group.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the first card in the group using the TAB key or to the last card in the group using the SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader should announce the `label` parameter value prior to announcing "grouping" and any other information in or associated with the card.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for "group". The result should be a `<div>` having `role="group"` set on it. Ensure the DOM node referenced by the `aria-labelledby` attribute set on the element having `role="group"` contains text.|
|Card Group Layout|The card group layout component MUST have a `label` parameter set when more than one card is present in the group.|**SAIL Testing**: Verify a `label` parameter value has been provided for `a!cardGroupLayout` when more than one card is present in the group.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the first card in the group using the TAB key or to the last card in the group using the SHIFT + TAB keys (if there are no active cards present, put the screen reader into Browse mode and read the beginning of the card group using the Arrow keys). The screen reader should announce the `label` parameter value prior to announcing "grouping" and any other information in or associated with the card.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Search for "group". The result should be a `<div>` having `role="group"` set on it. Ensure the DOM node referenced by the `aria-labelledby` attribute set on the element having `role="group"` contains text.|
|Color Contrast - Text|Regular-sized text MUST have at least a 4.5:1 color contrast ratio between the text and background it is used on.|**Manual Testing**: Use the Colour Contrast Analyser (https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)<br><br>**Tool Testing**:<br>• **axe DevTools**: Run a page scan in a browser, do not scan the page in Appian designer.<br>• **ANDI**: Either cycle through all text elements in the interface or hover over them with a mouse.|
|Color Contrast - Text|Large text (at least 18 point or 14 point bold) MUST have at least a 3:1 color contrast ratio between the text and background it is used on.|**Manual Testing**: Use the Colour Contrast Analyser (https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)<br><br>**Tool Testing**:<br>• **axe DevTools**: Run a page scan in a browser, do not scan the page in Appian designer.<br>• **ANDI**: Either cycle through all text elements in the interface or hover over them with a mouse.|
|Color Contrast - Image/Icon|Images/icons that convey information and are not redundant to other text MUST have a color contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the part of the image that conveys information and any adjacent color(s).|Manual: Use the Colour Contrast Analyser (https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)|
|Color Contrast - Selected State|Color that indicates an element as being currently selected MUST have at least a 3:1 color contrast between the color used to indicate the selected state and the default color used for the same area of an adjacent, unselected element.|Manual: Use the Colour Contrast Analyser (https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)|
|Color Use - General|Color MUST NOT be used as the only means of identifying visual elements, e.g., statements such as "Click the red button", "content is below the blue heading", etc.|Visual inspection.|
|Magnification - 200%|All text content MUST be readable, functional, and does not overlap when the browser is magnified to 200% with the interface tested in a browser (not Appian Designer), use CTRL+"+" five times. If text is truncated, a method is provided for accessing the text.|**Browser Testing**: <br>• Test in a web browser with the browser maximized, do not test in Appian Designer<br>• Use the built-in browser zoom<br>• Magnify the content to 200% by pressing CTRL + "+" five times (a browser popup will inform you when you reach 200%)<br>• Reset to default magnification by pressing CTRL+0|
|Magnification - 400%|Loss of content or functionality MUST NOT occur AND content MUST NOT require both vertical and horizontal scrolling when the browser width is set to 1280 pixels and the browser window is magnified to 400% with the interface tested in a browser (not Appian Designer), use CTRL+"+" eight times. Grids and complex images are exempt from this requirement.|**Browser Testing**:<br>• Test in a web browser, do not test in Appian Designer.<br>• Set the browser width to 1280 pixels.<br>• Use the built-in browser zoom. Magnify the content to 400% by pressing CTRL + "+" eight times (a browser popup will inform you when you reach 400%).<br>• Reset to default magnification by pressing CTRL+0.|
|Dynamically-Added Content|Inputs and controls that are dynamically added to the page MUST occur in the tab order after the control that added the content unless visible instructions warn the user of the positioning prior to the content being added. If non-sighted users cannot be warned of the functionality beforehand, then `a!messageBanner` is used with the `announceBehavior` parameter set to `ANNOUNCE_ONLY` to instruct users where on the screen the content has been added.|**Keyboard Testing**: After activating the control that adds the new content, use the TAB key to navigate forward to the newly-added content.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: If content is not added in the forward tab order, navigate to the control that adds the content using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader must indicate where the content will be added when the control receives keyboard focus, not when surrounding content is read in screen reader Browse mode. The screen reader must convey a semantic location, such as "after the XX heading". It must not indicate references such as "left" or "right". If instructions are not provided prior to the addition of content, activate the control that adds the content. The screen reader should then announce that content has been added and where it has been added. A screen reader announcement is considered as a last resort - it is preferred that the content be added downstream from the user (in the forward tab order).|
|Dynamic Status Messages|Dynamic status messages MUST use the message banner component (`a!messageBanner`) with an appropriate value for the `announceBehavior` parameter and any text parameter(s) used.|**Screen Reader Testing**: Ensure the screen reader is running and perform the action that invokes the dynamic message to be displayed.

In some cases, the text alternative may also be inside of a node contained within the link.|
|Icon|[USED WITH TEXT IN A LINK] A text alternative MUST be provided for the icon ONLY if the link text does not already convey the same information as the icon. If a text alternative is needed for the icon, it MUST be set via the `altText` or `caption` parameter on the icon (do not use accessibility text or a tooltip set on the link, use of only the altText parameter is preferred).|**SAIL Testing**: Verify the `altText` or `caption` parameter value used for the icon.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Navigate to the link using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys. The screen reader should announce a text alternative for the icon in addition to other text included in the link.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Locate the icon.

The screen reader should ignore the icon and announce nothing.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Locate the SVG icon. Verify the SVG has `focusable="false"`, `tabindex="-1"`, and `aria-hidden="true"` set on it, and there is no `aria-label` attribute set on the SVG.|
|Image of Text|Images that contain text MUST NOT be used unless the image is a logo or the font used in the image cannot be accurately rendered by a web browser.|Visual inspection.<br><br>**Manual DOM Inspection**: Locate the image, determine the image source. Determine if the text is embedded in the image or if it uses CSS to be overlaid on the image.|
|Tooltip|Tooltips made visible on mouse hover MUST be able to become visible using only a keyboard (typically by navigating to the tooltip with the TAB or SHIFT+TAB keys).|Identify where tooltips are used in the interface. For each tooltip, navigate to the element that spawns the tooltip on mouse hover using the TAB or SHIFT + TAB keys with the keyboard.|
|Stamp|Tooltips that convey important information MUST NOT be set via the `tooltip` and `helpTooltip` parameters on `a!stampField`.|**SAIL Testing**: Inspect `a!stampField` and ensure the `tooltip` and `helpTooltip` parameters either do not exist or are set to a null value.<br><br>**Screen Reader Testing**: Put the screen reader into Browse mode and read the stamp. This is an important testing method because some tooltips set on stamps cannot be made visible on mouse hover or with a keyboard, they are available only to screen readers.|
